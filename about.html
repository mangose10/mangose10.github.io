									<h3>Origin</h3>
									<p>I began to show interest for programming in the latter half of eigth grade. I would look up lecture videos for Computer Science, in fact the first language I "learned" was python from what the professor was teaching, but that interest soon faded as I entered Highschool. I didn't get involved in coding again until tenth grade where I joined my school's programming club. In the club, activities where anything but abundant and everything was self taught so not much process was made by my part. The only thing that I can say with confidence is that I came out with a year and a half of experience in C# because the other language that was promoted in the club, the one I began with, has no use outside of video game creation(GML). Right now I strive to do as much as possible to stand out in College. I've been signing up for Hackathons as sugested and applied for volunteer work in hopes that one day I will work for a large company of my field.</p>

									<h3>Fun Fact #1</h3>
									<p>I'm the type of person that can't go to sleep until most or all of the work necessary is done; I blame this on the fact that I get motivated very easily. At the same time its a big fault of mine. Sometimes I get so excited to work on a new project that I leave the previous one unfinished even though the toughest part might have been finished. Although this could be fixed this with a little discipline. The longest I've gone without sleeping is 55 hours straight. Three sleepless nights where I attempetd to watch a years worth of episodes while maintining school work and attending class. #ThePowerOfMonster</p>

									<h3>Fun Fact #2</h3>
									<p>On my free time I like to play video games and watch anime. I rarely go out anymore, but lately I've been playing beach volleyball with other students. In highschool I was in Track and Field and Cross Country for four years; I even became the MVP for the last two years and was awarded the scholar athlete award at my school, but starting College I was hesitant to join any recreational club.</p>
